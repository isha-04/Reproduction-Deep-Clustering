# Reproduction of "Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features"

Reproduction of the code of the paper “Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features” by Facebook AI Research in 2018. Created a complete reproduction of the DeepCluster network with Power Iteration Clustering and AlexNet.

There is a lot of data in the world, data that is difficult to use since a lot of it is unlabelled. Following the theme around the original paper, a problem statement that resonated with me was working with methods that can be trained on large-scale datasets with no supervision.

Classified images from a sample of the ImageNet dataset of 64 classes, each with 600 images. <br>
Also tried running the algorithm on a secondary animal dataset of 10 classes with a total of 28000 images.

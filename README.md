# Reproduction-Deep-Clustering

Reproduced code of the paper “Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features” by Facebook AI Research in 2018. Created a complete reproduction of the DeepCluster network with Power Iteration Clustering and AlexNet.

Classified images from a sample of the ImageNet dataset of 64 classes, each with 600 images
Also tried running the algorithm on a secondary animal dataset of 10 classes with a total of 28000 images.
